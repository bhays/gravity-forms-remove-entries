Remove Gravity Form entries by form or date range.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why would I want this? =

If you need to remove a large number of entries and removing 20 at a time isn't working, this plugin is for you. Also, if you need to remove entries from a given date range, you can do so.

= Will this delete all my entries? =

No, this only moves entries to the trash. Once in the trash you can permanently delete them or leave them as is.

= Can I delete entries from multiple forms at once? =

No, this only handles one form at a time.
