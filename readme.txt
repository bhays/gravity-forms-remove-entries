Remove Gravity Form entries by form or date range.

== Description ==

WordPress plugin for Gravity Forms that allows for easy removal of entries from forms. Remove all entires or entries specified by a date range.

== Installation ==

4. Navigate to Forms->Remove Entries to select your form and remove the entries

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why would I want this? =

If you need to remove a large number of entries and removing 20 at a time isn't working, this plugin is for you. Also, if you need to remove entries from a given date range, you can do so.

= Will this delete all my entries? =

No, this only moves entries to the trash. Once in the trash you can permanently delete them or leave them as is.

= Can I delete entries from multiple forms at once? =

No, this only handles one form at a time.
